Ques:What is Blurring
Ans:If a blurred image is observed carefully then a common thing to notice is that image is smooth meaning edges are not observed. A filter used for blurring is also 
called low pass filter, because it allows low frequency to enter and stop high frequency. Here frequency means the change of pixel value. Around 
edge pixel value changes rapidly as blur image is smooth so high frequency should be filtered out
Gaussian blurring doesnâ€™t weigh each pixel equally, however. The closer a pixel is to the center, the greater it affects the weighted average used to calculate the new center pixel value. The image below demonstrates this function. This method assumes pixels closest to the center pixel will be closest to the true value of that pixel, so they will influence the averaged value of the center pixel greater than pixels further away"
